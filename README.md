# Memory-Allocation-Simulator

This project is a Memory Allocation Simulator developed as part of an Operating Systems course by Dhawal Khandelwal . It demonstrates how memory is dynamically allocated to processes using four classic allocation algorithms:

First Fit

Best Fit

Worst Fit

Next Fit

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The simulator is built using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript. Users can:

Input custom memory blocks and process sizes

Choose an allocation algorithm

Visualize memory usage dynamically (allocated blocks shown in red, free blocks in green)

ðŸŽ¯ Educational Purpose
This tool is designed to help students and learners understand dynamic memory allocation strategies visually. It provides insights into:

Memory utilization and fragmentation

Performance differences among allocation methods

Real-time simulation of process-to-memory mapping

ðŸ“š Key Concepts Demonstrated
Static vs. Dynamic Allocation

Fragmentation handling in various fit strategies

Multiprogramming and memory efficiency
